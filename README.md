# Golf Performance Analytics Dashboard

This project is a Streamlit web application designed to analyse personal golf data. It connects to a Google Sheet, calculates a comprehensive set of performance statistics, and visualises them using interactive Plotly charts. The goal is to provide actionable insights into my golf game to help identify areas for improvement.


## ‚õ≥Ô∏è Features

-   **Dashboard Interface:** Clean, tab-based layout built with Streamlit.
-   **Dynamic Data:** Fetches the latest round data directly from a Google Sheet.
-   **Comprehensive Stats:** Calculates metrics for all major facets of the game: Scoring, Driving, Approach, Short Game, and Putting.
-   **Interactive Visualizations:** Uses Plotly to create engaging and filterable charts.
-   **Secure:** Manages Google API credentials securely using Streamlit's secrets management.
